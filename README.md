{
  "message": "Your message here"
}
```

### Responses Success (200 OK)

```json
{
  "status": "Ok",
  "message": "Message successfully sent!"
}
```

Description: The message was successfully published to the RabbitMQ queue.

#### Bad Request (400 Bad Request)

```json
{
  "status": "BAD_REQUEST",
  "message": "The request must include a non-empty 'message' property in the request body."
}
```
